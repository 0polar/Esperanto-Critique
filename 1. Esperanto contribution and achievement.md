There are many critiques of Esperanto, but mainly concentrated in a few aspects, such as the language scheme itself: hat letters, gender suffix, accusative case, etc.; outside the language, critiques are including: Esperanto have no rely on culture, without the support of political forces, and not many people know so it is impossible to shake the status of English and etc..

Although the author's position is not optimistic about Esperanto, but critiques of Esperanto are not in place. *Esperanto Critique* want to help the readers that interested in Esperanto issues to fully understand the real problem of this language, through investigation, summary, and critique Esperanto language scheme and Esperanto community, propaganda and other issues that outside the language.

As the first article of this series, we begin to talk about the contributions and achievements of Esperanto. Many people around the languages community have a disdainful and contemptuous attitude to Esperanto, but they may not know that Esperanto is a some-success language, or we may have never known what Esperanto is.

Esperanto has already passed the best of its time, but today still has a power that can not be underestimated, have certain scale of Esperanto organizations and Esperantists in the world many countries, Esperanto activities are very abundant, and the Esperantists have been working tirelessly to promote Esperanto, engage in activities, gatherings, meetings, organize online or offline courses. And in history, Esperanto always have a scale not too big or too small, created a very rich text, get strong development early, make Esperanto early occupation of a large market share (of course, the market itself is very small), and has the advantage continues to this day. All other international auxiliary languages have to live under the shadow of Esperanto, and everyone in the IAL community knows more or less about Esperanto. This is the power of Esperanto.

Since Esperanto is so strong, why do not a few people know this language among ordinary people? Let alone to achieve its name of the target, to become a veritable "world language"? (The name of the language is actually the wrong of Chinese characters, its official name is Esperanto, meaning "hope".) These questions are this series want to answer. In the article after this article will do a comprehensive analysis.

Let's start to understand what is good about Esperanto. Any language can be divided into three core parts: voice, grammar, vocabulary, and a non-core part: text. Any person who learns foreign languages will first learn voice and text, then gradually learn grammar and vocabulary, as well as the usability of language.

## 1. Spelling consistent and one voice per letter

The first contribution of Esperanto is to achieve the goal of spelling consistent, and even further, one voice per letter. 

Why spelling consistent so important? People who have learned English for more than ten years should be deeply experienced: Meet a new English word, probably do not know how to read, so have to look up the phonetic in the dictionary. In recent years, the "natural spelling method" has been more and more touted, advocates claim that natural spelling method can enable learners correctly read the pronunciation of words without phonetic symbols. 

This kind of propaganda is obviously exaggerated: English spelling will always be filled with exceptions, can not use a complete set of rules to describe.

For example, we know **o** in open syllables read /əʊ/, similar to *Oh*, such as *mobile*; but in closed syllable read /ɔ/, such as *pot*. But note that in some words, letter **o** can also read /ʌ/, such as *love*; the most extreme case even read /i/, such as *women*. Obviously, the natural spelling method can not solve all the words of the spelling problem, even have lots of rules, may only be enough to solve 80% words. If 10% words are must look up the dictionary to get the correct pronunciation, then this hard-to-learn, complexity, spelling rules can't meet people's wishes.

Of course, English is really weird in the Latin alphabet languages. But spelling inconsistencies also appear in other languages, such as French. Although the vast majority of French words can be directly read out their pronunciation through the text, but there are still a few exceptions, such as tail **s** need to pronounce *bus* and so on. And French dictation let learners headache, a large number of homophones makes the difficulty of correctly dictation is not small, when heard /sɛn/, is it *seine* or *scene*?

Except English and French, other languages may not be too bad spelling, but Esperanto ambition is clearly not just "not too bad", it wants "one voice per letter": A letter only one pronunciation, a pronunciation only corresponds to a letter. (Later some of IAL schemes think one voice per letter is not necessary, and therefore did not adhere to this principle.)

Leaving the problems of Esperanto alphabet system and word spelling, the design of "one voice per letter" the word is absolutely a gospel for the people have long been dissatisfied English spelling. After all, see words can know how to read, and dictation has become no longer so terrible things. Later IAL clearly sees the benefits of this principle, even if there is no harsh to one voice per letter, but also at least to do the spelling consistent (except Interlingua, the extreme pursuit of natural).

This has to be said to be one of the major contributions of Esperanto. But before Esperanto, Volapük has done this, so in this field, the Esperanto's credit is not too big.

## 2. Mark part of speech with suffix, and use suffix for PoS conversion

English speaker should know PoS in English is how important, although with the English grammar more analytical, PoS is more and more blurred, but when see the suffix such as *-tion*, *-ment*, *-ity*, *-ture*, *-ness*, still able to distinguish this is a noun. And see *-ous*, *-able*, *-ful* suffix can also distinguish this is an adjective. But the basic words have no such suffixes as marks, we still have to remember suffixes for what kinds of PoS. And more headaches are at PoS conversion, if we want to convert nouns into adjectives, which suffix should use? Can all use *-ous*, such as dangerous? But this can not explain why the adjective of *wood* is *wooden* and the adjective of *sense* is *sensitive*. (Let alone *sensitive* ^ *sensible* and *awful* ^ *awesome*, two words that meaning are exactly opposite but spelling are similar make learners headache.)

Esperanto use of the same suffix for all words, is a very important initiative, let vocabulary suddenly become very simple. Nouns all end with *-o*, easy to know this is a noun, and more this rule remove the annoying grammatical gender, unify into one suffix.

The unity of the suffix makes the unity of the morphological changes have the opportunity: noun-plurals all add *-j*, nouns all add *-n*, avoid to memorize irregular plurals. And the verb present tense all *-as*, past tense all *-is*, make Esperanto avoid the irregular verbs, which is one of the most trouble for foreign language learners.

There is completely no irregular verbs, no irregular nouns, no irregular adjectives, make Esperanto suddenly become very simple, which is probably the dream of many foreign language learners, and therefore it is the biggest feature of Esperanto. But it seems that the other auxiliary language does not accept it, and many auxiliary language words do not inherit the rules of the suffix, but instead mix together the form of nouns, verbs, adjectives.

## 3. Affix construction system

As the Esperanto suffix system makes the vocabulary particularly regular, thus giving us space to construct new words the same rules, including prefixes and suffixes.

Esperanto word remove the suffix is the word root, such as *instrui* (teach) remove the verb infinitive suffix *-i*  to get the root *instru-*. We add the suffixes to the root, then add the needed suffixes, can easily get a new word, for example, we use *-ist-* (who is a professional person) add to *instru-* and add the noun suffix *-o*, get *instruisto* (teacher). The suffix can also be superimposed, for example, add *-in-* (female) to *instruisto*, get the *instruistino* (female teacher).

The same can be used prefix, such as the most commonly used antisense prefix *mal-*, can be added to a lot of words, especially adjectives, such as *granda* (large) can become *malgranda *(small), *proksima* (near) can become *malproksima* (far). And *ek-* (start), such as *eklabori* (start work).

Esperanto affixes are different from natural language, its affixes are unique, so there is no expression that "things can be..." have *-able* and *-ible* two suffixes. This is also a reflection of Esperanto regularity.

Use affixes to construct words is a great advantage, later auxiliary languages also learned from. But it is also the use of some affixes to the Esperanto has brought a lot of controversies, such as female suffix *-in-* but no male suffix, the expression of men can directly use the original words, there is sex discrimination.

# 4. Extremely inclusive word sources

For this point, whether the advantage is controversial, I do not think this is a good thing. But for the early Esperanto, this is a very important reason why they decided to embrace Esperanto and abandon the Volapük, especially they were all Europeans.

Inclusiveness of word sources, is mean Esperanto can be more easily accepted "foreign words" to become their own words, if a word in the Esperanto does not exist, then we can create a new word. For example, we do not know how to say "hospital", we can take the hospital directly, and then give it the Esperanto of the noun suffix *-o*, into the *hospitalo*, a new Esperanto word birthed so relax and happy. Initially Zamenhof only stipulated a few words, so now in the present Esperanto, lots of vocabularies are gradually added to the later users.

Since the word sources of Esperanto comes mainly from Romans (Latin, French, Spanish, Italian), English, German and Russian, the early Esperantists of these areas were able to introduce the vocabulary of their native language with great confidence: If I don't know how to say a word, then just fine to take my native language into Esperanto.

But it is not a good thing for people outside of Europe, many new words obviously can be used in the original words of Esperanto to form, such as the term "hospital" is often used *malsanulejo* (*mal-san-ul-ej-o*, not healthy person place (noun), where *san-* is the root, and *mal-*, *-ul-*, *-ej-* are affixes), without having to use *hospitalo*. On the problem of the vocabulary, the future of the article which will be more detailed to explore.

The above is the language design contributions to international auxiliary languages by Esperanto, the design of the suffix and affix is the most worthy of the award, and the most helpful to refer and learn. However, on Esperanto language scheme itself, I am afraid that the advantages and contributions have only these listed above, and other grammar design, such as syntax and other aspects can even be regarded as the weakness of Esperanto. If the Esperanto has a very regular suffix of the affix to join the language of learning, I am afraid that after learning a few lessons you will find yourself too naive.

For the Esperanto problems, the later articles will be explained in detail.
